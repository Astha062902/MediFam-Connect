# MEDIFAM CONNECT
A Webapp that streamlines the organization and accessibility of family health records.
## Problem Statement
 * Maintaining healthcare records for an entire family is a burdensome and disorganized task, often shouldered by one individual. Managing numerous physical files, prescriptions, and lab reports leads to inefficiencies and potential errors in healthcare management.

 * Patients, coming from diverse educational backgrounds, often struggle to convey comprehensive medical histories or describe their current medications accurately. Many patients lack knowledge about their family medical history, further complicating the process for healthcare providers. Healthcare professionals are burdened with manually sifting through records and reports to gather essential information for effective treatment.
  
There's a pressing need for a streamlined solution that simplifies the organization and accessibility of family healthcare records while addressing patients' varying levels of medical literacy and knowledge about their medical histories.
## Solution
